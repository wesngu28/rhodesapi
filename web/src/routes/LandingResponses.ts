        "I'm too frugal? I don't think so, I just live the way I want. Machinery is good, but I don't need it to do anything fancy. Same goes for my clothes, only the stuff I make myself suits me best. If you have fewer needs, then of course you spend less money.",

        "When my dad was killed, I honestly thought there wasn't a single good man among the Sarkaz. But now that I think about it, I was too naive at the time. How can stuff like race or appearance decide if someone's good or bad? No matter what your race is, as long as you look out for one another, you're family.",

        "Sometimes the commander reads books that are really hard to understand.. I remember a line went somethin' like this, 'People built cities, but refused to adapt to them.'
