			"Talk after Trust Increase 3": "I've... I've never been able to put that much faith in anyone, not even...",
			"Idle": "Doctor? You fell asleep? Hmph. How careless.",
			"Onboard": "I am the leader of L.G.D.'s Special Inspector Group, Ch'en. I have my own reasons, but I'll be joining you for a while. Seeing as we're already well acquainted from our prior work together, I'll ask you to take me to the office now.",
