			"biography": "Surtr is a mysterious Sarkaz girl who suffers from amnesia, perhaps due to her Oripathy. Her condition is rarely seen even among Infected. She is currently undergoing treatment at Rhodes Island. During testing, Surtr displayed an inexplicably high combat prowess, and was quickly drafted as a combat operator.",

				"Appointed as Assistant": "You've failed to complete the tasks within your purview, and are now asking me for help?",
				"Talk 1": "Don't expect me to instruct others in Originium Arts. I have no interest in wasting time with plebeians.",
				"Talk 2": "I'm not here because I have to, but because I want to.",
				"Talk 3": "The people I hate most are the ones who ask too many questions. I hope you are not one of them.",
				"Talk after Promotion 1": "It appears that you have gained some understanding of my Arts by now. I do hope you are aware of the danger as well.",
				"Talk after Promotion 2": "Before I realized it, these Arts and this staff had already become my steadfast companions. I do not remember when I gained such power. Of course, I do not actually care.",
				"Talk after Trust Increase 1": "I possess all kinds of memories. I don't know from whence did they came, nor do I know which truly belong to me. To discover the source of my memories, I have been traveling back and forth, from country to country, and now I have arrived at Rhodes Island.",
				"Talk after Trust Increase 2": "There is truly nothing better than an ice-cream to calm me down when I am absorbed in chaotic memories. I always relied on ice-cream, when I was alone.",
				"Talk after Trust Increase 3": "These memories of Rhodes Island are completely different from those before. They have a sense of realism about them. For the first time, I'm able to feel that I am truly myself. All of this is thanks to you, and all of Rhodes Island. ...What? I am capable of giving thanks where it is deserved, all right?",
				"Idle": "Tch... what a waste of time.",
				"Onboard": "I am Surtr. Are you the Doctor they mentioned? I will be working at Rhodes Island, starting today. I hope that you will not bore me too much.",
				"Watching Battle Record": "That's it?",
				"Promotion 1": "Have you started to value me after witnessing my power?",
				"Promotion 2": "You value not my power, but me myself? Then I shall put in the appropriate level of effort to repay you.",
				"Added to Squad": "Am I needed now?",
				"Appointed as Squad Leader": "I alone am enough.",
				"Depart": "Let's go.",
				"Begin Operation": "Are they the ones to be eliminated?",
				"Selecting Operator 1": "Do not order me around.",
				"Selecting Operator 2": "Enough, I understand.",
				"Deployment 1": "Not a bad position.",
				"Deployment 2": "I'm on it!",
				"In Battle 1": "Die!",
				"In Battle 2": "Don't even think about running!",
				"In Battle 3": "Laevatain!",

				"4-star Result": "Hmph. Piece of cake.",
				"3-star Result": "Naturally.",
				"Sub 3-star Result": "Can you not even do such a simple thing?",
				"Operation Failure": "If can do nothing to help, just retreat! I'll handle this.",
